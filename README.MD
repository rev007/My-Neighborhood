## Neighborhood Map ##

## May 2017 ##

### About ###

Neighborhood Map was initially written to learn how to use the KnockoutJS framework along with the Google Maps and Instagram APIs. The code is an MVC pattern with preset markers that represent points of interest within a neighborhood map.

The concept of the project is that people who live in the same neighborhood can share information that is very specific to their community. Informational markers represent points of interest and residents can add them if they feel it gives some value to the neighborhood. The goal is to create an atmosphere of sharing and togetherness on a small scale.

### How to Run ###

1. Add all of the files to a folder
2. Open index.html from your favorite browser

### Getting started

1. The neighborhood map has pre-set customized points of interest
2. Click on a marker (or a list item) to display information
3. Use the search box to show just the points you want to see
4. Photos are linked to the markers through an Instagram account by setting the caption text of the marker to be identical to an Instagram photo's title.
